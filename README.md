## Setup

1. Set your stack name (required)

Add this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export GROUP_PROJECT_STACK_NAME=timeazon
```

Then reload your profile:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
# or
source ~/.bashrc
```

2. Log in to AWS

Make sure you are authenticated with the correct profile.

---

## Reset project

From the root of the project run:

```bash
./reset.sh
```

This will:
- remove `node_modules`
- reinstall dependencies
- rebuild the client app

---

## Clean up AWS (important)

Before deploying, go to CloudWatch → Log groups in eu-west-2.

Delete any log groups that contain:

timeazon

Lambda log groups are not deleted with the stack and can cause redeploy issues if names clash.

Only delete log groups related to this project.

---

## Deploy

Navigate to the CDK directory:

```bash
cd cdk
```

Preview the infrastructure:

```bash
npx cdk synth
```

Deploy the stack:

```bash
npx cdk deploy
```

---

## Seed the database

After deployment:

1. Go to AWS Lambda
2. Find the function: timeazon-bootstrap
3. Run a test invocation

This will populate the database with initial data.

## Common Issues

### CDK deploy fails with ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
- Go to CloudFormation
- Delete the failed stack
- Re-run deploy

---

### Aurora version error
If you see:
Cannot find version X for aurora-postgresql

Use:
```js
rds.AuroraPostgresEngineVersion.VER_15_14
```

---

### Docker / bundling errors
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Restart Docker if needed

---

### AWS not authenticated
Run:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If it fails, log in again.

---

### Changes not showing
Rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
npm run build
```

---

## How this system works

1. React app is built locally
2. CDK deploys infrastructure
3. Lambda handles backend logic
4. Bootstrap Lambda seeds the database
5. CloudFront serves the frontend
